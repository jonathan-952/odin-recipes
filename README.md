Odin-recipes

This is my first HTML project. It is going to serve the purpose of a recipe book and demonstrate my skills in HTML

Skills I have demonstrated: I know the html boiler-plate and I don't need a reference anymore, I can link to other pages, display picture on web browser, use ordered and unordered lists, how to use git workflow to commit different stages of my project, develop a better file structure

What I need to work on: Learn how linking to other parent directories works and why it works. I still am not sure how "../" works and I need to learn more about absolute and relalitve links.
