Odin-recipes

This is my first HTML project. It is going to serve the purpose of a recipe book and demonstrate my skills in HTML

Skills I have demonstrated: I know the html boiler-plate and I don't need a reference anymore, I can link to other pages, display picture on web browser, use ordered and unordered lists, how to use git workflow to commit different stages of my project, develop a better file structure

What I need to work on: Learn how linking to other parent directories works and why it works. I still am not sure how "../" works and I need to learn more about absolute and relalitve links.

Edit1: I added basic CSS to the index.html file to change things like font, background color of the page, and added a gif. One thing that wasn't working for me was I couldn't apply CSS to any of the other HTML files, just the index.html. It seems to be a problem with not being able to load local resources from my desktop to the web because of permission. Another issue might be that I might have jumbled up the selectors which is causing the styling not to show through.
